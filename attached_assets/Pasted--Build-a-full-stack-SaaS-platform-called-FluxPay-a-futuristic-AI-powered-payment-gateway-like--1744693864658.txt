> Build a full-stack SaaS platform called *FluxPay* — a futuristic, AI-powered payment gateway like Stripe or Razorpay. The platform must include:
> 
>### 1. *Futuristic Landing Page*
> - Modern UI with 3D elements, gradient layers, and animations (Framer Motion).
> - Sections: Hero (FluxPay - Dynamic and Seamless Transactions), Features, Integrations (dynamic), Testimonials, Pricing, CTA.
> - Mobile responsive (Tailwind CSS) and CMS-driven (admin-controlled).
> 
>### 2. *Merchant Dashboard*
> - Secure login/signup (OAuth2.0, JWT).
> - Real-time analytics: transaction volume, fraud alerts, currency routing.
> - Tools: Payment link creation, subscription management, split payments, API key manager.
> - Embedded finance modules: escrow, instant payouts, merchant lending (mock).
> - KYC onboarding flow using AI (upload ID, face match, OCR).
> 
>### 3. *Admin Panel*
> - Admin login with RBAC.
> - Control all user accounts and merchant activity.
> - Activate/deactivate integrations.
> - Manage CMS content for landing page.
> - Control AI thresholds for fraud detection.
> - Review, approve, and track automation engine integration logs.
> 
>### 4. *Automation Engine for 200+ Integrations*
> - AI-powered microservice in the admin panel that:
>     - Scans APIs of popular SaaS tools like CRMs, ERPs, etc.
>     - Builds OAuth + REST-based integration templates.
>     - Auto-posts them in the “Integrations” tab for merchants with dynamic SSO support.
>     - Learns from trending SaaS tools to suggest the next set of integrations.
> - Admin view for controlling which integrations go live.
> 
>### 5. *AI Core Services*
> - Custom fraud detection using PyTorch (IP, device, behavior, velocity).
> - Smart payment routing engine using rules + ML optimization.
> - KYC/AML processing: OCR, Face Match (using AI).
> - Revenue and anomaly analytics in the dashboard.
> 
>### 6. *Tech Stack*
> - *Frontend*: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
> - *Backend*: Node.js (Express), Python for AI microservices
> - *Databases*: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
> - *AI*: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
> - *Cloud/Infra*: AWS S3, EC2, Lambda, Docker, Kubernetes
> - *Authentication*: OAuth2, JWT, SSO for integrations
> - *Security*: PCI-DSS compliant design, tokenized storage, encrypted KYC docs
> 
>### 7. *Miscellaneous*
> - Webhooks, real-time alerts
> - Custom API builder for developers
> - Auto-generated reports in the merchant panel
> - Escrow account logic with basic simulation (bank partner ready)
> 
>*Deploy entire platform as a containerized microservice architecture. Use monorepo with clear folders: /frontend, /backend, /admin, /ai-core, /automation-engine. Add seed data and mock API responses for demo purposes.*
